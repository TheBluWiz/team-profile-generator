  ## Going Forward
  - This code could be useful for a variety of team types. Pending the need, the data types for employees are easily adjusted to represent a companies needs. 
  - It would be neat to have several versions of pre-generated CSS documents allowing you to choose a style for your team. This could include various colors and also potentially allow you to choose a background image.
